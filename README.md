🏎️ F1 Race Strategy Analysis

This repository contains my data analysis projects in Formula 1, with a focus on tyre degradation, stint strategy, and race pace comparisons.

I use the FastF1
 Python package to access timing, telemetry, and tyre data from F1 sessions, and then visualize and model strategy choices.
