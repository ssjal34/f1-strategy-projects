🏎️ F1 Race Strategy Analysis

This repository contains my data analysis projects in Formula 1, with a focus on tyre degradation, stint strategy, and race pace comparisons.

I use the FastF1
 Python package to access timing, telemetry, and tyre data from F1 sessions, and then visualize and model strategy choices.

ferrari_vs_mclaren_monza2025.py → Medium stint pace comparison between Ferrari and McLaren during the 2025 Italian Grand Prix.

monza2025_fp2_deg.py → Tyre degradation regression analysis using FP2 long runs.

monza2024_stint_lengths.py → Violin plots of stint lengths by compound from the 2024 Italian Grand Prix race.
